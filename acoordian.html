                    <b>Another striking feature of this temple is that it is built with bricks that are so light that they can easily float on water. The temple which is situated in a valley took nearly 40 years to be completed. Elaborate carvings line the walls and also cover the pillars and ceilings of the temple.
                        Ramappa Temple, also known as the Rudreshwara temple, is a Kakatiya style Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, located in Palampet village, Mulugu district, Telangana, India.

                        The Warangal Fort, which is the main attraction of the city is spread over a radius of 19 kilometers between Warangal and Hanamkonda. The fort was constructed in the 13th century in the reign of the Kakateya King Ganapati Deva. 
                        During Eighth Century A.D. , Warangal with an old name “Orukal” has served as Capital City of Yadava king of the Kakatiyas or Ganapatis making Warangal as Capital City.
                        The Warangal fort is most famous for its graceful and finitely carved arches and pillars.
                        For a third and final time, the fort was attacked by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq ( r. 1325–1351), who held siege over the fort.
